# Socket Programming in C

This is an example of socket programming in C. Two programs, a server and a client, to play a "guess the number" type game. Both server and client programs can be compiled on windows and linux. Windows requires lwsock32 and lWs2_32 libraries to be added to the linker.

Made for a school project.
