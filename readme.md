# Socket Programming in C

This is an example of socket programming in C. Two programs, a server and a client, to play a "guess the number" type game. Both server and client programs can be compiled on windows and linux. Windows requires lwsock32 and lWs2_32 libraries to be added to the linker. If you are getting "stdio.h: No such file or directory" error while trying to compile on Linux, then you should install "libc6-dev" library (UBUNTU) or install "libc-dev" library (Alpine Linux).

Made for a school project.
